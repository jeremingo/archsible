# qmk

installs and sets up [qmk](https://docs.qmk.fm) using [my fork](https://github.com/jeremingo/qmk_firmware) of the firmware.

the repository is cloned under *~/code/qmk_firmware*.

### additional setup

- sets the default keymap to *jeremingo*, meaning only the keyboard should be specified when compiling/flashing with qmk.
